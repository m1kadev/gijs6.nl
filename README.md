My personal site with some random stuff I built :D

Flask + Jinja is just amazing. Has my blog, a todo app (ProLi), grade calculator thing, and probably some other random experiments.

## Run it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then visit `localhost:7000` and there you go!
