# Introduction

Hello there! Welcome to this "blog" :D  

But that word "blog" doesn't give you any information about what you can expect to find on this "frequently updated website"[1]; "blog" is a word without actually that much meaning to it.
Is a blog a place to talk about your latest projects? Is a blog a place to reflect on what you have achieved (*like a NLT-logboek*)? Is a blog a collection of stories from a road trip through Western Senegal? Is a blog a place to rant about politics? Is a blog just an old place where people wrote things before Twitter existed? Is a blog a place to showcase your work and impress others? Should a blog be made out of lengthy essays with fancy references, or should it be made out of short messages about anything that is on someone's mind?  
I think a blog can be all of those, and it definitely shouldn't be a precisely defined thing, **and that is amazing**.

And I do not know the purpose of this blog, I just wanted to write some things, and I wanted a little place on the internet to store and show them, so here I am.

*This is probably the worst welcome post in existence*
